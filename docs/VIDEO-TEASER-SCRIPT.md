## B-Roll Shots Needed

Capture these for flexibility in editing:

1. **Hands on tablet** - various angles, holding, tapping
2. **Couch/relaxed setting** - establishing shot
3. **Terminal activity** - Claude working (multiple takes, different tasks)
4. **Portal desktop** - sessions opening, closing, switching
5. **Phone version** - same workflow on phone (alternative device)
6. **Coffee/casual moments** - lifestyle shots showing "not at desk"

## Voice Lines to Record

### Your voice (natural, conversational):
1. "Add a logout button to the settings page"
2. "Spawn a worker to run the tests"
3. (Optional) "Fix the bug in the auth flow"

### TTS responses (use actual AgentWire TTS):
1. "Done. I added the logout button to settings."
2. "Tests passed."
3. (Optional) "I found the issue. Fixing it now."
