# AgentWire Demo Video Plan

> Target: 3-4 minutes for YouTube, 60s teaser for social

## Structure

### 1. Hook (10-15 seconds)
**Show the magic moment first** - You on your phone/tablet, speaking "Add a logout button to the settings page", then cut to Claude working on it and responding via voice.

### 2. Problem (15-20 seconds)
"Claude Code is powerful, but you're tethered to your keyboard. What if you could control it from anywhere - your couch, your phone, while making coffee?"

### 3. Solution Walkthrough (2-2.5 minutes)

| Segment | What to Show | Why It's Compelling |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Push-to-talk** | Hold button on phone → speak → release → Claude receives | Core magic moment |
| **Voice response** | Claude responds, TTS plays through your device | Two-way conversation |
| **Multi-session** | Portal showing 2-3 sessions, switch between them | Power user feature |
| **Spawn worker** | "Spawn a worker to handle the tests" → pane appears | Parallel execution |
| **Safety hooks** | Try dangerous command, see it blocked | Trust/safety angle |

### 4. Call to Action (15 seconds)
- "pip install agentwire-dev"
- GitHub link on screen
- agentwire.dev URL

### 5. Outro (5 seconds)
Dotdev logo/branding

## Recording Setup

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Screen recording** | OBS or ScreenFlow |
| **Phone footage** | Screen mirror or film the device |
| **Audio** | Clean voiceover, show actual TTS responses |
| **Editing** | Quick cuts, highlight clicks/buttons |

## Deliverables

1. **Short teaser (60s)** - Just the magic moments, perfect for Twitter/HN
2. **Full demo (3-4 min)** - YouTube main video with more context

## Key Principles

- **Under 4 minutes** - Higher completion rate
- **Real use case** - Actually building something, not fake scenarios
- **Before/after** - Keyboard-bound → voice-free workflow
- **Show, don't tell** - Developers spot shallow content instantly
